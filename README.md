<h3> Wallet app created with React using react three fibre, drei, and three.js. </h3>
<br />

Built for Covalent's Fantom OMW Campaign. 
Tracking finances and looking at money can be daunting. I believe the wallet experience should be fun and provide a different way of looking at transactions. Instead of the generic list layout for transactions (so boring ðŸ˜ž) I opted for nodes rotating around the user's central wallet. In defi, the interconnectedness of each user is what makes decentralized finance so powerful.
